# Cable
PyQT application to dynamically modify Pipewire and Wireplumber settings at runtime.

I wanted to make my workflow bit easier so I asked Claude 3.5 Sonnet to write it for me, and it did. You shouldn't need to restart Pipewire or Wireplumber at any point. These buttons are there for convenience. 

Just run:
`python Cable.py`
